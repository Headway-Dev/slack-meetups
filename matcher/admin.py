    - the space complexity of this function is O(N+M) where N is the number of

      higher time complexity

      have a higher chance of receiving a duplicate match because there are
      fewer unmatched people remaining to choose from, and this is a greedy
      algorithm that doesn't backtrack. phrased another way, all of the
